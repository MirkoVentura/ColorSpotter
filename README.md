# SwiftUI Camera Example with MVVM Pattern

## Overview
This project serves as an example of utilizing the camera feature in iOS apps using SwiftUI along with the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern. By following this project, developers can understand how to integrate camera functionality into their SwiftUI-based applications while adhering to best practices in code organization and separation of concerns through MVVM.

## Features
- Capture photos using the device's camera
- Display captured photos in the app
- Utilize MVVM pattern for improved code maintainability and scalability

## Requirements
- iOS 14.0+
- Xcode 12.0+
- Swift 5.3+

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the project on a simulator or a physical device.

## Usage
1. Launch the app.
2. Grant necessary permissions for accessing the camera if prompted.
3. Tap on the camera button to capture a photo.
4. View the captured photo in the app.

## Architecture
This project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern:
- **Model**: Represents the data and business logic of the application.
- **View**: Presents the user interface and interacts with the ViewModel.
- **ViewModel**: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View, processing data from the Model and updating the View accordingly.
